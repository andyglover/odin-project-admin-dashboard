## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

CSS Grid was my go to on this project. It took a lot of time to get each element into place, but once I got the hang of it, it really started to come together, which was so satisfying!

## Optimizations

I'd love to add some interactivity and hover effects to bring this dashboard to life!

## Lessons Learned:

Constructing a complex layout with CSS Grid is a great skill to have in my toolbelt and this project really gave me a good grasp of it!
